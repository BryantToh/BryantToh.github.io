                    Kendo is a modern Japanese martial art, descended from kenjutsu that uses bamboo swords as well as
                    protective armor. Today, it is widely practised within Japan and has spread to many other nations
                    around the world, including Singapore.

                        There are several fundamental points that cannot be overlooked in the history of kendo.
                        The first is the advent of the “nihonto”, or the Japanese sword. The Japanese sword emerged in
                        the
                        middle of the Heian period (794-1185), and had a slightly curved blade (sori) with raised ridges
                        along its length called “shinogi”. The prototypes of this style of sword were used by tribes
                        of horsemen in northern Japan during the 9th century. Since then, this style of sword was
                        adopted by samurai, and forging technology advanced rapidly during the early period of warrior
                        hegemony from around the end of the Kamakura period (1185-1333). The shape of the blade was
                        distinctive with its elevated sides (shinogi). In modern Japanese, the term “shinogi-wo-kezuru”
                        means “grinding the shinogi together”—in other words, “a tight contest”. Such is the influence
                        of
                        the ideals of the sword in Japanese culture.

                        After the Onin War (1467-77), Japan experienced political and social chaos for over a century.
                        It was during this epoch that many schools of swordsmanship (kenjutsu) arose. In 1543, firearms
                        were introduced into the island of Tanegashima off the southern tip of Japan. The Japanese sword
                        was forged using the tatarafuki casting method using high quality iron sand. However, it did not
                        take long before this technology was applied to the production of firearms. As a result, the
                        heavily-armored fighting style that prevailed hitherto changed dramatically to a lighter
                        hand-to-hand
                        style of combat. This in turn resulted in the further development and specialization of sword
                        forging
                        technology, as well as the establishment of more refined techniques and skills of swordsmanship
                        which
                        have been handed down to the present day through various schools such as the Shinkage-ryu and
                        Itto-ryu.

                    <div class="textadjust">
                        During the peaceful Edo period in Japan (1603-1867), swordsmanship evolved from focusing on
                        killing techniques to
                        emphasizing concepts like "katsunin-ken" (the life-giving sword). This period saw the
                        development of theories for
                        victory in combat and guiding practitioners in leading disciplined lives. Various books, such as
                        Heiho Kadensho,
                        Fudochi Shinmyoroku, and Gorin-no-sho, elaborated on the art of warfare and spirituality,
                        influencing kendo to this day.
                        The works conveyed to the samurai how to apply swordsmanship in their daily lives and deal with
                        questions of life and
                        death. Samurai studied these writings to refine their bujutsu skills and cultivate their minds.
                        Swordsmanship focused
                        their minds on distinguishing good from evil and being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice
                        for their clan and lord if necessary.
                        During this time, kenjutsu (sword techniques) in the Tokugawa period developed into graceful
                        techniques derived from
                        actual combat. Many masters contributed to the evolution of kendo, including Naganuma
                        Shirozaemon Kunisato and
                        Nakanishi Chuzo Kotake, who introduced new training methods and equipment such as protective
                        armor and the shinai
                        (bamboo-sword). Inter-school competitions became popular, and swordsmen traveled across the
                        country seeking stronger
                        opponents to improve their skills.
                        In the 19th century, new types of equipment, such as the yotsuwari shinai and the do (torso
                        protector), were introduced.
                        Three prominent dojos of Edo gained popularity for their full-contact fencing with bamboo swords
                        and protective armor.
                        Chiba Shusaku systematized the waza (techniques) of shinai training in the "Sixty-Eight
                        Techniques of Kenjutsu," many of
                        which are still used in kendo today. These developments contributed to the preservation of the
                        "bushido spirit" even after
                        the feudal system's collapse and continue to be an essential part of the Japanese culture.

                        After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the samurai class was dismantled. The wearing of swords was
                        eventually prohibited and the popularity of kenjutsu declined dramatically.
                        Although shunned as outdated and useless in the theatre of modern warfare, various events during
                        the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877—an unsuccessful resistance movement of samurai against the newly
                        formed imperial government—led to a revival of traditional swordsmanship among government forces
                        and the national police agency as means for effective physical training. In 1895, the Dai-Nippon
                        Butokukai was established as a national umbrella organization to promote traditional martial
                        arts
                        in the modern era. This coincided with the publication of Nitobe Inazo's world famous treatise
                        in
                        English, Bushido: The Soul of Japan, which addressed the culture and philosophy of the samurai.

                        In 1912, the “Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kendo Kata” (later renamed to Nippon Kendo Kata) was
                        created to unify classical schools of swordsmanship and pass on the essence and techniques
                        of the Japanese sword to later generations. It was also to supplement training with bamboo
                        replicas, and make kendo training more realistic. In 1919, Nishikubo Hiromichi officially
                        changed the designation of “bujutsu” and “kenjutsu” to “budo” and “kendo”. Replacing the
                        suffix of “jutsu” (technique or art) with “do” (Way) was meant to accentuate the educational
                        and spiritual aspects of kendo, rather than the technical or competitive side.

                        After the Second World War, kendo was prohibited for a while under the Occupation of the
                        Allied Forces. In 1952, however, when the All Japan Kendo Federation was established, kendo
                        was formally resurrected. Kendo presently plays an important role in school education and
                        is also popular with people of all ages and walks of life. Several million kendo practitioners
                        enjoy participating in regular sessions of keiko (kendo training).
                        Furthermore, kendo is gaining interest all around the world. The International Kendo
                        Federation (FIK) was established in 1970 and the first triennial World Kendo Championships (WKC)
                        was held in the Nippon Budokan in the same year. The 17th World Kendo Championships were held in
                        Incheon, South Korea, in September 2018 with competitors from 56 countries and regions
                        participating.
                        The 18th World Kendo Championships is scheduled to be held in Villebon-sur-Yvette, France, in
                        May 2021.

                        Chūdan-no-kamae is one of the five stances in kendo: jōdan, chūdan, gedan, hassō, and waki.
                        It is a basic stance that balances attack and defense, concealing the trunk and right wrist from
                        the opponent.
                        The stance allows for striking distance while maintaining good defense and is essential for
                        learning the
                        correct striking distance (issoku-ittō-no-maai).

                        In Chūdan-no-kamae, the left foot is slightly behind the right with the left heel slightly
                        raised.
                        Both feet are parallel, hips are forward, shoulders are relaxed, and the spine is perpendicular
                        to the floor.
                        The center of gravity should be centered between both feet. The shinai is held with the hands in
                        front of the waist,
                        with the tip of the weapon pointed at the opponent's throat.

                        used for deflecting
                        blows and creating striking opportunities. It is a transition stance used to move into a

                        This stance was commonly used when there was no standard sword length, serving as a bluff
                        technique and concealing
